# SIMPCOIN - The simple, lightweight, educational  Cryptocurrency

## Description
This is a simple Javascript BlockChain and CryptoCurrency implemented in Javascript.
I made this in order to better understand how a proof-of-work blockchain works, and how we can 
add the functionality of having a cryptocurrency based on that simple blockchain.

This is based on a series of tutorials made by Savjee, who runs an awesome YouTube channel called **Simply Explained**.

## Technology Stack
* Backend - Node.js
* Frontend - AngularJS + Bootstrap
